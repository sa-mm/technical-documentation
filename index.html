                </header>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
                    Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                    its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
                    elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
                    variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document
                        Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on
                        an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript
                        on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
                        provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file
                        manipulations on a server.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                    <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                    <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main
                        page about JavaScript.</li>
                </ul>

                <header>
                    Hello World
                </header>
                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript
                    code:</p>
                <code>function greetMe(yourName) {
  alert("Hello " + yourName);
}
greetMe("World");</code>
                <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>

                    Variables
                </header>
                <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers,
                    conform to certain rules.</p>

                <p> A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters
                    can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through
                    "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>

                <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape
                    sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

                    Declaring Variables
                </header>
                <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
                <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
                <code> x = 42</code>
                <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>

                <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
                <code>x = 42</code>
                <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
                    variant.</p>

                <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
                <code>let y = 13</code>
                <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>
            </section>
            <section id='Variable_Scope' class="main-section">
                <header>
                    Variable Scope
                </header>
                <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available
                    to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called
                    a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>

                <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within
                    a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following
                    code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared,
                    not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>

                <code>if (true) {
  var x = 5;
}
console.log(x);  // 5</code>
                <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>

                <code>if (true) {
  let y = 5;
}
console.log(y);  
// ReferenceError: y is not defined</code>
